# Old-New-Codes

While studying I used to think about my past programs, how I came in that _solution_ and why I can't code some _desired feature_. With these idea I've decided to revisit my codes to review, rework and maybe re-do these programs.

I want to achieve some kind of a _review of my ideas, watch my progress in logic, algorithms, paradigms, languages and everyting I've learn._ At same time, I want to _rewrite_ my applications in other languages, just for fun.

Some codes has english comments and logs, others, created for college classes stay in portuguese.
